# Description

Snyk provides a quick and simple way to detect insecure package dependencies and optionally enables you to patch/upgrade the vulnerabilities in place.

This task supports:

 * Scanning for insecure dependencies (snyk test)
 * Protecting your project by fixing or patching insecure dependencies (snyk protect)
 * Register your project with snyk to be notified of future issues (snyk monitor)
 
You can supply your snyk API-token through a service connection (recommended) or a text input.
 
This task depends on snyk, which is not bundled in the current version. There are a few options available:

 * Install snyk by prepending a NPM package task:
  * command: `install`
  * arguments: `snyk --prefix "$(Build.WorkFolder)\_tools"`
  * working directory: e.g. `$(Build.WorkFolder)\_tools`
  * Supply the path to snyk in the 'Path to Snyk' input, e.g. `$(Build.WorkFolder)\_tools\node_modules\.bin\snyk.cmd`

 * Install snyk on your build server
  * Optionally add its path to the systems path environment variable
  * Or supply the path to snyk in the 'Path to Snyk' input

Find the task in the Utility category of both Build and Release.

# Future options
 
 * Wildcard support in path to project?
